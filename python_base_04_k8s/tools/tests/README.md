# State Management System Tests

This directory contains tests for the core state management system.

## Test Files

### `test_state_manager.py`
Basic test script for the StateManager functionality. Tests core state management operations without being a module.

## What's Tested

### 1. Basic State Operations
- ✅ State creation (`register_state`)
- ✅ State retrieval (`get_state`)
- ✅ State updates (`update_state`)
- ✅ State listing by type (`get_states_by_type`)
- ✅ State deletion (`delete_state`)

### 2. State Transitions
- ✅ State transition validation
- ✅ Transition types: activate, suspend, resume, expire
- ✅ Transition history tracking

### 3. State History
- ✅ State change history tracking
- ✅ History entry management
- ✅ Version control

### 4. State Callbacks
- ✅ State change notification system
- ✅ Callback registration and execution

## Running the Tests

```bash
# From the project root
cd python_base_04_k8s
python3 tools/tests/test_state_manager.py
```

## Test Results

The tests run successfully and demonstrate:
- ✅ Core state management functionality works
- ✅ State transitions are properly handled
- ✅ History tracking is functional
- ✅ Callback system is operational
- ✅ Memory-based storage works (Redis/DB optional)

## Architecture Benefits

This core state management system provides:

1. **Generic & Business-Logic-Agnostic**: No specific user states, subscription logic, etc.
2. **Centralized State Orchestration**: All application states managed in one place
3. **Declarative State Management**: Same methods produce different outputs based on state
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new state types and transitions
5. **Persistent**: Multi-layer storage (memory, Redis, database)
6. **Observable**: State change notifications and history tracking

## Next Steps

With this core system in place, you can now:
1. **Modify UserManagement** to use state-dependent behavior
2. **Add subscription states** with declarative methods
3. **Implement feature flags** based on user states
4. **Create session management** with state transitions
5. **Build access control** based on state combinations
