# Service Manager Documentation

## Overview
The Service Manager provides a centralized system for registering, initializing, and managing application services. It handles service lifecycle, method invocation, and cleanup, ensuring proper service management throughout the application.

## Core Components

### ServicesManager
The ServicesManager class manages all service-related operations.

#### Class Definition
```python
class ServicesManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code
```

#### Dependencies
- Custom logging utilities

#### Core Features

##### Service Registration
- `register_service(service_key, service_instance)`
  - Validates uniqueness
  - Stores service instance
  - Logs registration
  - Raises errors for duplicates

##### Service Initialization
- `initialize_services()`
  - Initializes all services
  - Calls initialize method
  - Logs initialization
  - Handles errors

##### Service Retrieval
- `get_service(service_key)`
  - Retrieves service by key
  - Returns service instance
  - Logs retrieval
  - Returns None if not found

##### Method Invocation
- `call_service_method(service_key, method_name, *args, **kwargs)`
  - Validates service existence
  - Checks method availability
  - Calls method dynamically
  - Returns method result
  - Logs operation
  - Raises errors for:
    - Missing service
    - Missing method

##### Service Cleanup
- `dispose()`
  - Calls dispose method
  - Clears service registry
  - Logs disposal
  - Handles cleanup

## Configuration

### Service Interface
Services should implement:
- `initialize()`: Initialization method
- `dispose()`: Cleanup method (optional)

### Service Registration
- Unique service keys
- Service instance
- Proper initialization

## Usage Example
```python
# Initialize service manager
service_manager = ServicesManager()

# Register service
class DatabaseService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection = None
    
    def initialize(self):
        self.connection = "Connected to database"
    
    def query(self, sql):
        return f"Executing: {sql}"
    
    def dispose(self):
        self.connection = None

service_manager.register_service(
    "database",
    DatabaseService()
)

# Initialize services
service_manager.initialize_services()

# Get service
db_service = service_manager.get_service("database")

# Call service method
result = service_manager.call_service_method(
    "database",
    "query",
    "SELECT * FROM users"
)

# Clean up services
service_manager.dispose()
```

## Error Handling
- Validates service uniqueness
- Handles initialization errors
- Manages method calls
- Implements proper recovery

## Security Considerations
- Validates service registration
- Controls service access
- Manages service lifecycle
- Protects sensitive data

## Best Practices
1. Use unique service keys
2. Implement required methods
3. Handle initialization properly
4. Follow naming conventions
5. Document service functionality
6. Test service integration
7. Monitor service performance
8. Handle errors gracefully
9. Implement proper logging
10. Regular service updates
