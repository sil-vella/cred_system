# Credit System Security Checklist

This checklist is designed to ensure your external Credit System is secure, resilient, and tamper-proof, especially when integrated with blockchain/token operations.

---

## ✅ Authentication & Authorization

- [✅] Use OAuth2 or JWT-based service authentication
- [✅] Assign unique API keys per service (no shared keys)
- [✅] Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [✅] Verify request authenticity using HMAC signatures or signed payloads
- [✅] Require secure headers (e.g., X-Signature, X-Request-ID)

---

## ✅ Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

- [✅] Enforce rate limits per IP
- [✅] Enforce rate limits per user
- [✅] Enforce rate limits per API key
- [✅] Throttle burst traffic using Redis-based counters
- [✅] Auto-ban suspicious or abusive actors
- [✅] Log and alert on rate limit hits
- [✅] Rate limit headers in responses
- [✅] Configurable limits and windows
- [✅] Graceful degradation on Redis errors

---

## ✅ Input Validation

- [✅] Strict type and range validation on credit amounts
- [✅] Allowlist only valid transaction types (e.g., purchase, reward, burn)
- [✅] Sanitize all input fields (prevent injection attacks)
- [✅] Reject malformed or oversized payloads early

---

## ❌ Transaction Integrity

- [❌] Enforce idempotency via `transaction_id` on all credit-changing operations
- [❌] Prevent replay attacks by storing and checking recent transaction hashes
- [❌] Use strong UUIDs or ULIDs for all transaction and operation IDs
- [❌] Validate credit balance before processing any deduction

---

## ❌ Audit Logging

- [❌] Log every credit transaction with:
  - Timestamp
  - User ID
  - Action type
  - Credit delta
  - Source (service, IP, client)
- [❌] Use append-only storage or immutable logging (e.g., Kafka, object store)
- [❌] Enable retention rules (e.g., 1 year minimum)
- [❌] Store logs in multiple secure locations

---

## ⚠️ Database & Data Security

- [❌] Encrypt all sensitive data at rest (AES-256 or better)
- [✅] Use per-environment credentials (dev/stage/prod)
- [❌] Restrict access via database roles and network whitelists
- [❌] Enable read-only replicas for analytics and reporting
- [❌] Set up automatic daily backups and weekly test restores

---

## ❌ Blockchain Interaction Controls

- [❌] Validate all mint/burn requests internally before on-chain execution
- [❌] Store a mirrored ledger of blockchain state (for reconciliation)
- [❌] Rate-limit blockchain transactions to control gas usage
- [❌] Queue transactions and confirm completion before updating balance
- [❌] Handle and retry failed blockchain syncs gracefully

---

## ⚠️ Monitoring & Alerting

- [✅] Track metrics:
  - Rate limit hits
  - Remaining requests
  - Redis errors
- [❌] Alert on:
  - Spike in minting or spending
  - Unusual wallet activity
  - Blockchain desyncs
- [❌] Integrate with observability stack (Grafana, Datadog, etc.)

---

## ⚠️ Deployment & Secrets Management

- [❌] Only deploy signed containers or verified builds
- [✅] Use HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.2+)
- [❌] Rotate API keys and secrets regularly
- [❌] Store secrets securely (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [✅] Use isolated environments per tenant/project (dev, test, prod)

---

## ❌ Optional: Advanced Features

- [❌] Implement Zero-Knowledge Proofs or Merkle proofs for credit integrity
- [❌] Use multisig for on-chain critical actions (minting, burning)
- [❌] Publish regular public balance proofs (for transparency)

---

## ⚠️ Final Checklist Before Production

- [✅] All API access is authenticated and encrypted
- [❌] No credit-changing operations can be performed from client directly
- [❌] Internal services validated and authorized before affecting credit state
- [❌] Blockchain token balance matches internal ledger (reconciled)
- [❌] External audit/log review completed
